# process-killer

This script uses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to get a list of all running processes. It should correctly populate the list for you to select and close processes. 
Please note that some system processes may not be able to be closed for security reasons. 

Always be careful when closing processes as it can lead to system instability.

I've added a .EXE version of the .AHK file (compiled) so this script can be used without the need to download Auto-Hotkey.
